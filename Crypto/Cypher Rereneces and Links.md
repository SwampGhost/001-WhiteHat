- Basic Concept
	*  > 	Move the pointer to the right
	* < 	Move the pointer to the left
	+ 	Increment the memory cell under the pointer
	- 	Decrement the memory cell under the pointer
	. 	Output the character signified by the cell at the pointer
	, 	Input a character and store it in the cell at the pointer
	[ 	Jump past the matching ] if the cell under the pointer is 0
	] 	Jump back to the matching [ if the cell under the pointer is nonzero
